High throughput molecular annotation for imaging mass spectrometry datasets

## Main Features
- Centroided imzML files as input dataset files
- Apache Spark based implementation for easy scaling from one machine to a cluster
- Can be run in both local and distributed modes
- Comes with unit, regression and scientific tests
- [Web application](https://github.com/METASPACE2020/sm-webapp) for upload and browsing search results
- [Ansible project](https://github.com/METASPACE2020/sm-engine-ansible) for easy deployment to AWS

## Installation
Please check the [sm-engine-ansible](https://github.com/METASPACE2020/sm-engine-ansible) project

## Uploading Dataset and Browsing Results
Please visit the help page of our web application running on AWS:
